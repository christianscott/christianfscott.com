## "...just a monoid..."

**Associativity** is a property of some binary operations where the order of operations does not matter, e.g.  since addition is associative,`(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)`

A **finitary operation** is an operation with **finite arity**

An **algebraic structure** is a set A together with a collection of **finitary operations** on A

A **semigroup** is an **algebraic structure** with a single **associative** binary operation.

An **identity element** is an element of a set that leaves other elements unchanged when combined with them (with respect to some **binary operation**).

A **monoid** is a **semigroup** with an **identity element**

∴ monoids make sense

## "...in the category..."

A **morphism** is a mapping from some source object A to some target object B

An **identity morphism** is a **morphism** such that the source and target objects are the same object

A **category** is a collection of objects linked by **morphisms**, where the morphisms are such that they are **associative** and there exists an **identity morphism** for each object

∴ categories make sense

## "...of endofunctors"

A **functor F** is a *structure-preserving* map between categories. That is, given two categories C and D:

- it associates each **object** X in c to an **object** F(X) in D
- it associates each **morphism `g: X → Y`** in C to a **morphism `F(g): F(X) → F(Y)` in D** such that

    $$F(id_X) = id_{F(X)}, \space \forall X \in C$$

    $$F(g \circ h) = F(g) \circ F(h), \space \forall g:X \rightarrow Y \in C, \space \forall h: Y \rightarrow Z \in C$$

An **endofunctor** is a **functor** that maps a **category** to the same category

∴ endofunctors make sense

## So what's a monad?

...I've got no idea.
